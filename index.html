                    <p class="section-paragraph">Berlin's combo of glamour and grit is bound to mesmerise all those keen to explore its vibrant culture, cutting-edge architecture, fabulous food, intense parties and tangible history.</p>
                    <ul class="sub-info">

                            <h2 class="section-subheading">High on History</h2>
                            <p class="section-paragraph">Bismarck and Marx, Einstein and Hitler, JFK and Bowie, they’ve all shaped – and been shaped by – Berlin, whose richly textured history confronts you at every turn. This is a city that staged a revolution, was headquartered by Nazis, bombed to bits, divided in two and finally reunited – and that was just in the 20th century! Walk along remnants of the Berlin Wall, marvel at the splendour of a Prussian palace, visit Checkpoint Charlie or stand in the very room where the Holocaust was planned. Berlin is like an endlessly fascinating 3D textbook where the past is very much present wherever you go.</p>

                            <p class="section-paragraph">Forget about New York – Berlin is the city that truly never sleeps. Sometimes it seems as though Berliners are the lotus-eaters of Germany, people who love nothing more than a good time. The city's vast party spectrum caters for every taste, budget and age group. From tiny basement clubs to industrial techno temples, chestnut-canopied beer gardens to fancy cocktail caverns, saucy cabarets to ear-pleasing symphonies – Berlin delivers hot-stepping odysseys, and not just after dark and on weekends but pretty much 24/7. Pack your stamina!</p>

                            <h2 class="section-subheading">Laid-back Lifestyle</h2>
                            <p class="section-paragraph">Berlin is a big multicultural metropolis but deep down it maintains the unpretentious charm of an international village. Locals and expats follow the credo 'live and let live' and put greater emphasis on personal freedom and a creative lifestyle than on material wealth and status symbols. Cafes are jammed at all hours, drinking is a religious rite and clubs keep going through the weekend into Monday. Size-wise, Berlin is pretty big but its key areas are wonderfully compact and easily navigated on foot, by bike or with public transport.</p>

                            <p class="section-paragraph">When it comes to creativity, the sky’s the limit in Berlin, which is one of Europe's big start-up capitals. In the last 20 years, the city has become a giant lab of cultural experimentation thanks to a spirit that nurtures and encourages new ideas as well as to once abundant space and cheap rent. Although the last two of these are definitely a thing of the past. Top international performers still grace Berlin's theatre, concert and opera stages; international art-world stars like Olafur Eliasson and Jonathan Meese make their home here; and Clooney and Hanks shoot blockbusters in the German capital. Highbrow, lowbrow and everything in between – there’s plenty of room for the full gamut of cultural expression.</p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">Many of Berlin's must-see destinations are free to visit. Travellers can admire the Brandenburg Gate, visit the dome of the Reichstag, stroll the colourful East Side Gallery, and pay their respects at the Holocaust Memorial and the Berlin Wall Memorial, all for no cost.</p>

                                <p class="section-paragraph">The Neue Pinakothek is all about the 19th century, and houses masterpieces from Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne. Originally completed in 1853, the building was destroyed during WWII. Rather than rebuild the original structure, it was redesigned in a postmodernist style and opened in 1981.</p>
                                    
                                <p class="section-paragraph section-note">Note: The Neue Pinakothek is currently closed for renovation work, but you can still view some of the collection at the Alte Pinakothek and Sammlung Schack until it reopens in 2025. </p>

                                <p class="section-paragraph">A symbol of division during the Cold War, the landmark Brandenburg Gate now epitomises German reunification. Carl Gotthard Langhans found inspiration in Athens’ Acropolis for the elegant triumphal arch, completed in 1791 as the royal city gate</p>

Welcome to Museumsinsel (Museum Island), Berlin's most important treasure trove, spanning 6000 years' worth of art, artefacts, sculpture and architecture from Europe and beyond. Spread across five grand museums built between 1830 and 1930, the complex takes up the entire northern half of the little Spree Island where Berlin's settlement began in the 13th century.</p>

                            <p class="section-paragraph">This busy stall in Munich’s central open-air food market almost always has a queue. And with good reason. Skilled baristas and strong espresso provide the perfect respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. Kaffeerösterei Viktualienmarkt also does a mean Florentine biscuit; available with dark, milk or white chocolate, they are the perfect sugar hit to accompany your caffeine intake.</p>

                            <p class="section-paragraph">Unlike many of Berlin’s fine-dining establishments, this small restaurant prides itself on its informality – despite its place at number 37 on the world’s best restaurants list. The tasting menu might include amuse-bouches of spicy cashews, prawn sashimi and marinated pork belly, moving on to main courses of wagyu beef, lobster, Australian winter truffle and tofu. Everything has a Japanese touch and comes served with blobs, smears or foams of contrasting flavours and colours. Book ahead.</p>

                            <p class="section-paragraph">Meat-eaters should try Kreuzberg’s köfteci and ocakbasi for stomach-warming grilled lamb, lentil soup and fresh bread served late into the night. Alternatively, you could shell out to see what this year’s Michelin hype is all about – the buzz is well earned, by the way – or snuggle up at one of an array of newly opened bistro-cum-wine bars cropping up around Berlin’s coolest neighbourhoods. How’s that, culinary elite?</p>

                            <p class="section-paragraph">Nobelhart & Schmutzig's 28-seat counter in Kreuzberg wraps around a bustling open kitchen where young chefs, under the watchful eye of executive chef Micha Schäfer, do their thing. The space is exciting and intimate, especially when the cooks take turns serving the dishes and describe not only what you’ll be eating but where it came from: Everything is sourced from producers in and around Berlin. Locavores will be in heaven here and wine-loving friends will swoon—this is a dining extravaganza not to be missed.</p>

                                    <p class="section-paragraph">Beer has been part of Munich life for at least seven centuries and the brewing tradition is very much alive and kicking today. Nowhere else in Europe has a beer tradition quite like the Bavarian capital with six mammoth breweries pumping out world-class suds to hundreds of beer gardens and beer halls. And the climax to the Munich beer year is, of course, the famous Oktoberfest, attended by over six million people. Germany’s ‘purity law’ guarantees there’s nothing in your Mass (1L tankard) that shouldn’t be, so if you can lift the thing – ‘Prost!’ (Cheers!)</p>

                                    <p class="section-paragraph">Munich has long been known as the ‘city of art and beer’, so before you head off to the pub, take some time to savour the local art scene. The Kunstareal, Munich’s art quarter, is the place to start, with four major venues displaying everything from Dutch masters to 1960s design. The city also boasts some world-class museums focusing on topics as diverse as Oktoberfest, porcelain and BMW cars. And if that weren't enough, there are still royal palaces to explore – the legacy of 700 years of rule by a single family, the Wittelsbachs.</p>

                                    <p class="section-paragraph">The locals have a word for it – Gemütlichkeit – that untranslatable intermingling of cosiness, well-being and laid-back attitude. In Munich you will sense it most under the fairy lights of a summer beer garden, people-watching in the English Garden and behind the wheel of a BMW heading south. It may be just the local character, but a large share of Gemütlichkeit must come from the fact that the Bavarian capital is one of the most affluent cities on the planet, it’s economy larger than most small countries, its infrastructure well-tended.</p>

                                    <p class="section-paragraph">Munich’s various quirks, the things that make the city the place it is, might be what stick in the memory most. Whether it be the inebriated oompah band, that special knife for eating monster radishes, the Bavarians outrageous dialect, the mad hat traditions of the Oktoberfest or the surfers on the Eisbach wave – you’re sure to discover some freakish aspect of Munich life every day. And then there is the local garb – nowhere else in central Europe do the locals don their traditional costume – the famous Lederhosen and Dirndl – as readily as the Münchners, so why not join them?</p>

                            <p class="section-paragraph">Think of the art scene in Germany and Berlin is probably the first city that springs to mind. While there is no doubt that the capital is a hub of talent, other places boast a strong set of institutions too. Munich is home to some of the country’s biggest museums and most important collections, attracting creative minds from around the world. Here are some artistic highlights not to miss.</p>

                                        <p class="section-paragraph">Next to the Olympiapark, the glass-and-steel, double-cone tornado spiralling down from a dark cloud the size of an aircraft carrier holds BMW Welt, truly a petrolhead's dream. Apart from its role as a prestigious car pick-up centre, this king of showrooms acts as a shop window for BMW's latest models and a show space for the company as a whole.</p>

                                        <p class="section-paragraph">Even if you don't like beer, every visitor to Munich should make a pilgrimage to the mothership of all beer halls, if only once. Within this major tourist attraction, you'll discover a range of spaces in which to do your Mass lifting: the horse chestnut–shaded garden, the main hall next to the oompah band, tables opposite the industrial-scale kitchen and quieter corners.</p>

These include the Alte Pinakothek, the Museum Brandhorst, the Neue Pinakothek and the Pinakothek der Moderne.</p>

                                    <p class="section-paragraph">The food is certainly a match for the location. Dinner is spread across two sittings with the sunset dinner taking place at 6pm. For this, the restaurant have devised a dedicated Sunset Menu, which is stripped back to three courses and designed for those wishing to take in the views at the most beautiful time of day. The Feinschmecker Menu allows for a more fine dining experience and is served from 8pm onwards. The offerings change regularly to make best use of seasonal ingredients.</p>
