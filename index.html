                 <h1>About Berlin</h1>
                    <p>Berlin's combo of glamour and grit is bound to mesmerise all those keen to explore its vibrant culture, cutting-edge architecture, fabulous food, intense parties and tangible history.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>High on History</h3>
                            <p>Bismarck and Marx, Einstein and Hitler, JFK and Bowie, they’ve all shaped – and been shaped by – Berlin, whose richly textured history confronts you at every turn. This is a city that staged a revolution, was headquartered by Nazis, bombed to bits, divided in two and finally reunited – and that was just in the 20th century! Walk along remnants of the Berlin Wall, marvel at the splendour of a Prussian palace, visit Checkpoint Charlie or stand in the very room where the Holocaust was planned. Berlin is like an endlessly fascinating 3D textbook where the past is very much present wherever you go.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Party Paradise</h3>
                            <p>Forget about New York – Berlin is the city that truly never sleeps. Sometimes it seems as though Berliners are the lotus-eaters of Germany, people who love nothing more than a good time. The city's vast party spectrum caters for every taste, budget and age group. From tiny basement clubs to industrial techno temples, chestnut-canopied beer gardens to fancy cocktail caverns, saucy cabarets to ear-pleasing symphonies – Berlin delivers hot-stepping odysseys, and not just after dark and on weekends but pretty much 24/7. Pack your stamina!</p>

                    <h3>Places to visit</h3>
                    <p>Many of Berlin's must-see destinations are free to visit. Travellers can admire the Brandenburg Gate, visit the dome of the Reichstag, stroll the colourful East Side Gallery, and pay their respects at the Holocaust Memorial and the Berlin Wall Memorial, all for no cost.</p>

                                <p>The Neue Pinakothek is all about the 19th century, and houses masterpieces from Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne. Originally completed in 1853, the building was destroyed during WWII. Rather than rebuild the original structure, it was redesigned in a postmodernist style and opened in 1981.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Note: The Neue Pinakothek is currently closed for renovation work, but you can still view some of the collection at the Alte Pinakothek and Sammlung Schack until it reopens in 2025. </p>

                <h1>About Munich</h1>
                <p>Tall tankards and high-tech cars, edgy art and Lederhosen – Munich is a city where traditional and modern sit side by side like few places on earth.</p>
                   <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Mine's a Mass</h3>
                            <p>Beer has been part of Munich life for at least seven centuries and the brewing tradition is very much alive and kicking today. Nowhere else in Europe has a beer tradition quite like the Bavarian capital with six mammoth breweries pumping out world-class suds to hundreds of beer gardens and beer halls. And the climax to the Munich beer year is, of course, the famous Oktoberfest, attended by over six million people. Germany’s ‘purity law’ guarantees there’s nothing in your Mass (1L tankard) that shouldn’t be, so if you can lift the thing – ‘Prost!’ (Cheers!)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Teutonic Treasure Trove</h3>
                            <p>Munich has long been known as the ‘city of art and beer’, so before you head off to the pub, take some time to savour the local art scene. The Kunstareal, Munich’s art quarter, is the place to start, with four major venues displaying everything from Dutch masters to 1960s design. The city also boasts some world-class museums focusing on topics as diverse as Oktoberfest, porcelain and BMW cars. And if that weren't enough, there are still royal palaces to explore – the legacy of 700 years of rule by a single family, the Wittelsbachs.</p>
